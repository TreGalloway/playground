Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with Tailwind has been a tedious task that required a keen eye for typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.

By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you _really are_ just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.

We get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly asking us things like:

> Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my `h1` elements? How do I disable this? What do you mean I lose all the other base styles too?
> We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base styles is what you really want. You don't want to have to remove annoying margins every time you use a `p` element in a piece of your dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either — you want them to look _awesome_, not awful.

The `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin is our attempt to give you what you _actually_ want, without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base styles.

It adds a new `prose` class that you can slap on any block of vanilla HTML content and turn it into a beautiful, well-formatted document:

For more information about how to use the plugin and the features it includes, [read the documentation](https://github.com/tailwindcss/typography/blob/master/README.md).

My biggest accomplishment of 2022 was not my own, but the collective work of folks on my teams at Vercel. They've chosen to join me on this ambitious journey to make the web faster. I'd like to share the internal Slack message I wrote to celebrate their amazing work:

**Happy new year!** What better way to start 2023 than to celebrate the work the Developer Experience teams accomplished in 2022:

- Our monthly active community members **grew by 66%**, as measured by activity on Twitter, Discord, GitHub, and more. Our teams play a key role in helping grow, educate, and interact with members of the community. We even helped [many folks land jobs](https://twitter.com/nutlope/status/1512462016614703115) from our [Next.js job board](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/43787).
- We helped engage and answer questions from the community, resulting in [Discord](https://nextjs.org/discord) **growing 2x in size**, Reddit ([/r/nextjs](https://www.reddit.com/r/nextjs/)) **growing 3x in size**, and Next.js being one of the [top tags on StackOverflow](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1605997497976885248) with **96% growth**. This is largely a reverse kudos to the Next.js team!
- The DevRel team hosted community meetups in [New York](https://twitter.com/jaredpalmer/status/1509384199899332611), [Austin](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1531695305766445056), and [San Francisco](https://twitter.com/nutlope/status/1542927703166181377). We also spoke at 15 events, meeting with thousands of developers across the frontend community.
- It was a company wide effort, but we played a major part in Next.js Conf, which **55,000+** attended and **110,000+** registered. Delba, Lydia, and I were part of the [keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiknNI_0J48&list=PLBnKlKpPeagll1CCK08EvjqgCq0C_dXZq&index=4), Delba and I hosted the [preshow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93D-XH0tNRY&list=PLBnKlKpPeagll1CCK08EvjqgCq0C_dXZq&index=2), Hassan helped organize and select our [28 amazing community speakers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBnKlKpPeagll1CCK08EvjqgCq0C_dXZq), and the rest of the team was involved in various other ways.
- We supported many different product launches across Vercel, including Next.js ([v13](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-13), [v12.3](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-3), [v12.2](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-2), [v12.1](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-1)), [Edge Middleware](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-edge-middleware-dynamic-at-the-speed-of-static), [Edge Functions](https://vercel.com/blog/edge-functions-generally-available), [Edge Config](https://vercel.com/blog/edge-config-public-beta), [Vercel Analytics](https://vercel.com/blog/vercel-acquires-splitbee), [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/blog/build-output-api), [Turbopack](https://vercel.com/blog/turbopack), [Vercel OG Image Generation](https://vercel.com/blog/introducing-vercel-og-image-generation-fast-dynamic-social-card-images), [Comments for Preview Deployments](https://vercel.com/blog/making-live-reviews-a-reality-enhanced-preview-experience), and more. Depending on the launch, we help out with early testing of features, providing feedback on the API, or reviewing content / messaging for the launch.
- Our team helps write and approve content for social media. In 2022, we saw [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vercel) followers grow by **32%**, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/VercelHQ) subscribers grow by **78%** (**~1.5M views**, up 250% from last year), and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/16181286/admin/) followers grow by **145%**. We can't take full credit, though, so kudos to the rest of y'all for creating products and content folks want to try and learn about.
- Thousands of tweets and hundreds of direct messages later, we spent a considerable amount of time “digging deep” with customers to gather feedback on Vercel and Next.js and relay that feedback back to the team.
- We launched a [brand new free Next.js course](https://twitter.com/delba_oliveira/status/1503409381081325571), teaching the foundations of React and Next.js for beginners to get started. It's been continually maintained and updated throughout the year, based on community feedback. Hard to fathom, but the Next.js `/learn` courses have had **17 million page views** in 2022. Kudos to Delba!
- Our Vercel product documentation has had some major upgrades, including: framework-aware dynamic content, JavaScript/TypeScript toggles, improved search accuracy, a new table of contents, as well as refactoring many different pages and beginning to restructure the information architecture of the main navigation.
- We helped update a number of webpages, including: [/blog](https://vercel.com/blog) (categories and new design), [/customers](https://vercel.com/customers) (industry pages and new design), [/help](https://vercel.com/help) (improved search and new design), [/guides](https://vercel.com/guides) (searching and filtering), [/templates](https://vercel.com/templates) (brand new, over 100+ templates), and more.

And a few shoutouts…
